Absolutely! Here's a **clear and structured summary** of what you need to know to implement **raycasting** for your `cub3d` project in C. This covers the **core concepts**, **math**, and **implementation strategy**, tailored to the constraints of the project (usually inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, with a 2D map and a pseudo-3D rendering).

## 🧠 1. **Core Idea of Raycasting**

Raycasting is a technique to simulate a 3D view in a 2D environment by:

* Casting rays from the player's position (one per vertical screen column),
* Calculating the distance to the first wall hit,
* Using that distance to draw a vertical slice of the wall with the correct height (shorter if farther).

You repeat this for every column on the screen.

---

## 🧮 2. **Key Concepts and Math**

### 🧭 Player Data

You need to track:

* Position: `double posX, posY`
* Direction: `double dirX, dirY` (e.g. facing north = (0, -1))
* Camera plane: `double planeX, planeY` — perpendicular to `dir`, controls FOV

### 📏 Ray Per Column

For each screen column `x`, compute:

```c
double cameraX = 2 * x / (double)screenWidth - 1; // -1 to 1
double rayDirX = dirX + planeX * cameraX;
double rayDirY = dirY + planeY * cameraX;
```

This gives the ray direction for column `x`.

### 🧱 DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)

To find where the ray hits a wall on the map grid:

1. Compute current grid square: `int mapX = (int)posX;`

2. Compute ray step and side distance:

   * Calculate `deltaDistX`, `deltaDistY` — distance the ray has to travel to go from one x/y side to the next.
   * Determine `stepX`, `stepY` — direction to step in x and y.
   * Calculate `sideDistX`, `sideDistY` — initial distance to first x or y gridline.

3. Perform DDA loop:

   ```c
   while (!hit) {
       if (sideDistX < sideDistY) {
           sideDistX += deltaDistX;
           mapX += stepX;
           side = 0; // x-side
       } else {
           sideDistY += deltaDistY;
           mapY += stepY;
           side = 1; // y-side
       }
       if (worldMap[mapX][mapY] == '1') hit = 1;
   }
   ```

### 📐 Wall Distance and Height

```c
if (side == 0)
    perpWallDist = (mapX - posX + (1 - stepX) / 2) / rayDirX;
else
    perpWallDist = (mapY - posY + (1 - stepY) / 2) / rayDirY;

int lineHeight = (int)(screenHeight / perpWallDist);
int drawStart = -lineHeight / 2 + screenHeight / 2;
int drawEnd = lineHeight / 2 + screenHeight / 2;
```

### 🎨 Texturing (Bonus or Optional)

Use the wall side and ray direction to determine the correct texture and its x-coordinate.

## 🏗️ 3. **High-Level Steps**

### Initialization:

* Parse the map (a 2D char array of '1' and '0', maybe 'N', 'S', etc. for player start).
* Initialize player position and direction based on start direction.
* Initialize screen and graphics (via **MiniLibX**).

### Main Loop:

For each frame:

1. Clear screen.
2. For each column `x` in screen:

   * Cast a ray.
   * Find wall distance via DDA.
   * Compute wall height.
   * Draw vertical line.
3. Handle key input (move, rotate).
4. Render minimap or UI (optional).
5. Refresh screen.

## ⌨️ 4. **Controls**

* **Forward/back**: `W/S` — move in `dir` vector.
* **Left/right**: `A/D` — strafe using perpendicular vector.
* **Rotation**: arrow keys — rotate `dir` and `plane` using basic rotation matrix:

```c
double oldDirX = dirX;
dirX = dirX * cos(rotSpeed) - dirY * sin(rotSpeed);
dirY = oldDirX * sin(rotSpeed) + dirY * cos(rotSpeed);
```

---

## 🧪 5. **Debugging Tips**

* Draw a minimap first to test ray direction and collision.
* Print player coordinates and ray hits to console.
* Implement wall coloring by side (e.g. darker on y-sides).
